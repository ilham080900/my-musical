          <br /> Feels Like We Only Go Backwards
          <br /> Lonerism (2012)
          <br />  
          <br /> [Intro]
          <br /> Gm
          <br />  
          <br /> [Chorus]
          <br />                 F       C          Gm
          <br /> It feels like I only go backwards, baby
          <br />               F       C   Gm
          <br /> Every part of me says go ahead 
          <br />                    F        C  Gm
          <br /> I got my hopes up again, oh no not again 
          <br />               F       C         Gm
          <br /> Feels like we only go backwards darlin' 
          <br />  
          <br /> [Verse 1]
          <br /> Dm                                                     Cmaj7/G
          <br /> I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
          <br />                                    Dm
          <br /> But I hear it inside my head all day
          <br />                                                       G
          <br /> when I realize I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
          <br />                     Gm
          <br /> Your feelings don't show
          <br />  
          <br /> [Chorus]
          <br />                 F       C          Gm
          <br /> It feels like I only go backwards, baby
          <br />               F       C   Gm
          <br /> Every part of me says go ahead
          <br />                    F        C  Gm
          <br /> I got my hopes up again, oh no not again
          <br />                  F       C         Gm
          <br /> It feels like we only go backwards darlin'
          <br />  
          <br /> [Verse 2]
          <br /> Dm                                 Cmaj7/G
          <br /> The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
          <br /> Cmaj7/G
          <br /> Cause I decided long ago
          <br /> Dm                                                                       G
          <br /> but that's the way it seems to go when trying so hard to get to something real
          <br />    Gm
          <br /> It feels 
          <br />  
          <br /> [Chorus]
          <br />                 F       C          Gm
          <br /> It feels like I only go backwards, darlin'
          <br />               F       C   Gm
          <br /> Every part of me says go ahead 
          <br />                    F        C  Gm
          <br /> I got my hopes up again, oh no not again 
          <br />               F       C         Gm
          <br /> Feels like we only go backwards darlin'
          <br />  
          <br />                 F       C          Gm
          <br /> It feels like I only go backwards, baby 
          <br />               F       C   Gm
          <br /> Every part of me says go ahead
